A server for recieving web page timing information

## Motivation

Projects like [New Relic Browser](http://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring) and [Yahoo Boomerang](http://yahoo.github.io/boomerang/doc/) ship a lot of javascript, which we discovered can interact poorly with extant javascript. Uluru intends to provide a minimalist yet extensible tool for collecting web page timing information and shipping that information to Graphite or Splunk.

Uluru is named after a rock formation in Northern Territory, Australia. It is so-named because I originally started writing it as an endpoint for Yahoo Boomerang. What's a place to throw boomerangs? Uluru!

N.B. Uluru is sacred to the Anangu people; they probably would not appreciate you throwing boomerangs at the actual rock formation.
